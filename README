Executable program is under directory cmake-build-debug.

Please follow below order to run test cases:


1. Start Sql Client:
        Run ./sql_test cat outdir   
        (The second parameter has to be “outdir” or existing directory)
        
Note: The folder for table has to be current directory.


1. Create Table
        Create the table you want to run query on.


        E.g. 
        CREATE TABLE lineitem (
        l_orderkey        INT,
        l_partkey        INT,
        l_suppkey        INT,
        l_linenumber        INT,
        l_quantity        INT,
        l_extendedprice        DOUBLE,
        l_discount        DOUBLE,
        l_tax                DOUBLE,
        l_returnflag        STRING,
        l_linestatus        STRING,
        l_shipdate        STRING,
        l_commitdate        STRING,
        l_receiptdate        STRING,
        l_shipinstruct        STRING,
        l_shipmode        STRING,
        l_comment        STRING
);


2. Load data into table
        For example, run command: “load lineitem from lineitem.tbl;”

3. Run the SQL in test case.
        E.g. 
        select l.l_comment from lineitem as l where (l.l_shipdate = "1994-05-12") and (l.l_commitdate = "1994-05-22") and (l.l_receiptdate = "1994-06-10");
